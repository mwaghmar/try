NOTE: You should execute this on cislinux.cis.ksu.edu machine only.
	  acs executable needs ACE library to execute which we have installed on cislinux.cis.ksu.edu only.

      Server source code files are
	  		acs_server.cpp, acs_yacc.c, acs_token_parser.c, acs.h, acs_server.h, acs_yacc.h

STEPS to Execute:

1) ./acs <server policy file name> <port no>  <xsb executable path>

	The parameters <port no> & <xsb executable path> are optional.
	Default port is 5420 & Default xsb executable path is /usr/bin/xsb

	Example:
		./acs server_policy1.P 

	If you see execution failure because libACE.so failed to load then
	run following command

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/grads/mwaghmar/CIS751/Assignment-IV/ace/lib

	After exporting this env variable your server should run fine.

2) java -jar RepositoryManagerClient.jar <ip_addr_of_server> <port_on_server> <credential_file> 
											<private_key_file>

 Example:
  java -jar RepositoryManagerClient.jar 129.130.10.28 5420 client_credential.msg client.rsa.der 

3) Server log would show client authentication status & signature verification status.
   	
4) On client command prompt you can put your request queries.
   Example:
   	Request>allow(jeremiah,write)

	You should get reply from server as granted or denied.
